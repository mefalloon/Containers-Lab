# Exercise 1
# Create a list named students containing some student names (strings).
# Print out the second student's name.
# Print out the last student's name.

# students = ['Kanye', 'Kim_K', 'Pete']
#     print(students[1])
#     print(students[2])

# Exercise 2
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Use a for loop to print out the string "food goes here is a good food".

foods = ('oxtail', 'donut', 'tacos')

for food in foods:

    print(f"{food} is a good food ")  

# Exercise 3
# Using a for loop, print just the last two food strings from foods.
foods = ('oxtail', 'donut', 'tacos')

for food in foods[1:]:
    print(food)

# Exercise 4
# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state and population.
# Print a string with this format:
# "I was born in city, state - population of population"

home_town = {
    'city': 'Miami',
    'state': 'Florida',
    'population': 2
}

print(f"I was born in {home_town['city']}, {home_town['state']} - population of {home_town['population']}")


# Exercise 5
# Iterate over the key: value pairs in home_town and print a string for each item, for example:
# "city = Arcadia"
# "state = California"
# "population = 58000"


# Exercise 6
# Create an empty list named cohort.

# Using a for loop, add one dictionary to the cohort list for each student name. Each dictionary should have this shape:

#  {
#    'student': 'Tina',
#    'fav_food' 'Cheeseburger'
#  }
# Iterate over cohort printing out each element.


# Exercise 7
# Using the list of students and list comprehension, assign to a variable named awesome_students a new list containing strings similar to this:
# ["Tina is awesome!", "Fred is awesome!", "Wilma is awesome!"]
# Iterate over awesome_students printing out each string.


# Exercise 8
# Using the tuple foods and list comprehension within a for loop, print each food string that contains the letter a.
