# Exercise 1
# Create a list named students containing some student names (strings).
# Print out the second student's name.
# Print out the last student's name.

students = ['Kanye', 'Kim_K', 'Pete']
    print(students[1])
    print(students[2])

# Exercise 2
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Use a for loop to print out the string "food goes here is a good food".

foods = ('oxtail', 'donut', 'tacos')

for food in foods:

    print(f"{food} is a good food ")  

# # Exercise 3
# # Using a for loop, print just the last two food strings from foods.
foods = ('oxtail', 'donut', 'tacos')

for food in foods[1:]:
    print(food)

# # Exercise 4
# # Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state and population.
# # Print a string with this format:
# # "I was born in city, state - population of population"

home_town = {
    'city': 'Miami',
    'state': 'Florida',
    'population': 2
}

print(f"I was born in {home_town['city']}, {home_town['state']} - population of {home_town['population']}")


# # Exercise 5
# # Iterate over the key: value pairs in home_town and print a string for each item, for example:
# # "city = Arcadia"
# # "state = California"
# # "population = 58000"

for key, val in home_town.items():
  print( f"{key} = {val}" )



# # Exercise 6
# # Create an empty list named cohort.
# cohort = []
# # cohort = []
# # Using a for loop, add one dictionary to the cohort list for each student name. Each dictionary should have this shape:
# #  enumerate  --This lets you get the index of an element while iterating over a list


for index, student in enumerate(students):
  cohort.append({
    'student': student,
    'fav_food': foods[index]
  })

#    'student': 'Tina',
#    'fav_food' 'Cheeseburger'
#  }
# Iterate over cohort printing out each element.
for student in cohort:
  print(student)

# # Exercise 7
# # Using the list of students and list comprehension, assign to a variable named awesome_students a new list containing strings similar to this:
# # ["Tina is awesome!", "Fred is awesome!", "Wilma is awesome!"]
# # Iterate over awesome_students printing out each string.

awesome_students = [f"{student} is awesome" for student in students]
print(awesome_students)


# Exercise 8
# Using the tuple foods and list comprehension within a for loop, print each food string that contains the letter a.
# how to say I want (expression) foreach food in the list 
find_a = [food for food in foods if 'a' in food]
print(find_a)
